The symptoms were that when AIS client ran, it would delete all of its associated scheduled tasks, thus rendering the client inactive. This issue affects all AIS clients that were deloyed/installed after July 7<sup>th</sup>, 2008. Clients installed prior to July 7<sup>th</sup>, 2008 are not affected by this issue, and should continue to operate normally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe remedy for this issue is to redeploy any clients that were deployed after July 7<sup>th</sup>, 2008. This will recreate the associated schedule tasks, and the clients will then begin to upload inventory on their predetermined intervals. Once your redeployment is complete, it is suggested that you use the &ldquo;Update Inventory&rdquo; feature, which is located on the upper right-hand portion of the AIS home page, and which will in turn lead PCs to upload their inventory as quickly as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks</p>\r\n', NULL, NULL),

Mặc d&ugrave; điều n&agrave;y nghe c&oacute; vẻ buồn cười, nhưng c&oacute; một thực tế l&agrave; một người c&agrave;ng n&oacute;i to bao nhi&ecirc;u th&igrave; anh ta c&oacute; thể nghe thấy giọng m&igrave;nh r&otilde; hơn bấy nhi&ecirc;u v&agrave; khi đ&oacute; c&oacute; thể ph&aacute;t hiện lỗi của m&igrave;nh tốt hơn. Người học cũng c&oacute; thể sử dụng một m&aacute;y ghi &acirc;m để ghi lại lời n&oacute;i v&agrave; lắng nghe lại n&oacute; để t&igrave;m ra lỗi v&agrave; chỉnh sửa cho lần sau. V&iacute; dụ trong đoạn văn: &ldquo;In a city of secret economies, few are as vital to the life of New York as the business of nannies, the legions of women who emancipate high-powered professionals and less glamorous working parents from the duties of daily child care&rdquo;. Bạn đọc ch&uacute;ng khoảng 3 lần bạn sẽ thấy c&aacute;c từ trong đoạn văn n&agrave;y bạn sẽ ph&aacute;t &acirc;m tốt hơn r&otilde; rệt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buớc 2: Nghe v&agrave; nhắc lại</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>H&atilde;y nghe văn bản được đọc ch&iacute;nh x&aacute;c.

V&iacute; dụ như:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Nguy&ecirc;n &acirc;m (vowels): lưỡi nằm giữa khoang miệng, v&agrave; kh&ocirc;ng chạm v&agrave;o bất cứ bộ phận n&agrave;o trong miệng.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Phụ &acirc;m (consonants): 3 nh&oacute;m:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>+ m&ocirc;i (lips): để ph&aacute;t &acirc;m, 2 m&ocirc;i phải chạm nhau, v&iacute; dụ &quot;M&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;P&quot;; hoặc m&ocirc;i phải chạm răng, v&iacute; dụ &quot;V&quot;,&quot;F&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>+ sau răng (behind the teeth): lưỡi chạm phần sau của h&agrave;m tr&ecirc;n, v&iacute; dụ &quot;N&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>+ họng (throat): &acirc;m đi từ cuống họng (khi ph&aacute;t &acirc;m phải cảm thấy cuống họng rung), v&iacute; dụ &quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;,...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H&atilde;y d&agrave;nh v&agrave;i ph&uacute;t mỗi ng&agrave;y để tự m&igrave;nh tập ph&aacute;t &acirc;m c&aacute;c từ rồi tăng l&ecirc;n c&acirc;u tồi một đoạn văn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buớc 4: Hỏi xin lời khuy&ecirc;n.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>H&atilde;y nhờ một người bản xứ lắng nghe bạn khi bạn n&oacute;i.
